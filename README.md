# MarketPlanner
The issue of investment is urgent, so it requires careful research and a thorough approach to choosing an action strategy. There are a lot of things that are necessary to manage like an investment portfolio, formation strategy or percentage of high-risk and low-risk investments. It remarkably easy to manage such a thing with a tool, that can provide clear statistics, visualization, possible prediction, and collect other's opinions as well.

## App concept description 
The core concept of the app is to provide the tool for monitoring, analyzing, and reporting the data on the stock exchange market. Timely advice is an indispensable solution, especially for a novice investor. Based on previous and current values we can analyze, predict and suggest the strategy of investing. The highlight of the app is a tab "What the others think about it?" presented in the statistics form and based on ML algoritm that analizes comments on popular investment forums.  

## About us
